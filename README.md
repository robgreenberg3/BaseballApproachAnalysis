# BaseballApproachAnalysis
Baseball Analytics Repo for my research paper on Batter Approach vs. Run Differential 


Abstract:
I investigated three questions surrounding batters’ plate approaches in terms of
the pitch count per at bat. I wanted to know if batters change their approach in different
game situations, if batters change their approach in close games, and if batters “give
up” when winning or losing by a large number of runs. I did a series of data
transformations to form variables that would help me in my analysis and proceeded to
use the 2017 MLB season to examine my questions. I used both all 2017 batters and a
select group of elite batters to get a full picture of the trends I was exploring. I
determined that some batters have different approaches in some game situations,
batters generally don’t change their approach the later it gets in a close game, and
batters do not give up in wide margin games. Continue reading for a detailed look at my
hypotheses, methods, results and conclusions.
